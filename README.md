- 👋 Hi, I’m @Taher-Ghaleb
- 👀 I’m interested in applying AI and Data Science for Software Engineering and Continuous Integration (CI) data.
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards obtaining a Ph.D. degree from Queen's University, Canada.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in which I mine software repositories to uncover the causes of current problems and propose solutions to fix them.
- 📫 Please reach out to me if you are interesting in research collaboration, or you are hiring a research scientist.
