- 👋 Hi, I’m @Taher-Ghaleb
- 👀 I’m interested in data science with software engineering and continuous integration (CI)
- 🌱 I’m currently working towards obtaining a Ph.D. degree from Queen's University, Canada.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in which I mine software repositories to uncover the causes of current problems and propose solution to fix them.
